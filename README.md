# Solana Checker

Gm!

After being rugged many times, I've decided to build a simple dashboard/tool, that will decrease the chance of this happening. It should serve you as a guidance before you make a decision of DLMM'ing or simply buying the token.

This was mainly inspired by [@Seb Monty](https://x.com/SebMontgomery), who mentioned [@NAOJ](https://x.com/NaojNc/status/1897708760027566562) twtter post called "Token Sanity Check: How I Avoid Getting Rugged in Low Volume Markets". Make sure to give these guys a follow on twitter.
